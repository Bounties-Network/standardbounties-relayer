# standardbounties-relayer
A standalone and centralized relayer for the StandardBounties v2.0 smart contract

**IMPORTANT**: My implementation is already working on Rinkeby, but I didn't have spare time to include the instructions on how to deploy it and a tutorial on how the demo works. Please reach me at hernangt12re3@gmail.com to help you
